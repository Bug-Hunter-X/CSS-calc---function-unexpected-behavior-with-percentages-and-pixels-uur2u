# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function when combining percentages and other units (like pixels).  The issue occurs when calculating a width (or other dimension) based on a percentage minus a fixed pixel value.  In certain scenarios, the expected result might not be rendered correctly across different browsers or contexts.

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential solution or workaround to ensure consistent rendering.

This issue is less about a syntax error and more about the subtleties of how the browser interprets and renders calculations within the `calc()` function, particularly concerning the interplay between relative and absolute units.
