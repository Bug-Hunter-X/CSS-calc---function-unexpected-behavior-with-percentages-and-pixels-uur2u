One approach to solve this issue is to avoid mixing percentage and pixel units directly within the `calc()` function.  Instead, consider using a more robust approach using `vw` (viewport width) units.  `vw` units provide a more reliable calculation based on the viewport size, reducing inconsistencies.

For example, replace `width: calc(50% - 10px);` with a calculation using `vw`.  You'll need to perform a conversion to pixels, perhaps based on a JavaScript function that dynamically calculates the desired width, to ensure compatibility.

Another solution, when possible, would be to use only percentages for the width and adjust the content's padding to achieve the desired effect.
